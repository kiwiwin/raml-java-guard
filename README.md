#RAML Java Guard

##Problem

It is hard for API developers to always keep the API document up to date when API code has been updated. 
As time past, the gap between code and the document become larger, it cost much more time for communication between
API developer and front-end developers and the velocity of the team become slower.

##RAML

RAML is a language for the definition of HTTP-based APIs that embody most or all of the principles of 
Representational State Transfer (REST).

The specification of latest RAML 1.0 can be found here: https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/

##Solution

We recommend to use a Document Driven Development, that is write API document first, then the API schema written is document is used
 by the Java API.
 
##Example
